Description: Functions for estimating catalytic constant and Michaelis-Menten constant (MM constant) of 
             stochastic Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics model are provided. The likelihood functions 
             based on stochastic simulation approximation (SSA), diffusion approximation (DA), and 
             Gaussian processes (GP) are provided to construct posterior functions for the Bayesian 
             estimation. All functions utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with Metropolis-
             Hastings algorithm with random walk chain and robust adaptive Metropolis-Hastings 
             algorithm based on Bayesian framework.
